# VIDM
Display Manager inspired by vim/tmux, a fork of DWM by Suckless.org

# Goals
- keybindings would be as near to vim as possible
- keybindings should be easy to remember and there should be just a few of them.
- keybindings should be easy to type. Numbers are hard to type, so avoid numbers
- avoid combinations like Ctrl-Alt or Ctrl-Alt-Shift unless they are unavoidable and they should be easy to remember
- Create a "Normal" mode, which applies to windows and an "Insert" mode that applies to contents of current window.

# Why fork DWM?
DWM uses Alt as modifier and may application uses Alt to access the menu
